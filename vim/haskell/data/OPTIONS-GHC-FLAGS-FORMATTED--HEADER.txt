=================== OPTIONS_GHC FLAG REFERENCE (FORMATTED) =====================
== https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.10.4/docs/html/users_guide/flags.html
== the haskell.org link for GHC 8.10.4 given above is the source of all data.
== author: Prem Muthedath, 17 MAR 2023

== this file essentially has the same data as OPTIONS-GHC-FLAGS-ORIGINAL.txt, 
== but the data here has been formatted into columns of equal width.
== data formatted using `FormatOptionsGhcFlagsFile()` in vim/plugin/util.vim

== this data is needed to create a list of OPTIONS_GHC flags for haskell 
== OPTIONS_GHC pragma completion in haskell files using vim.

== NOTE: lines starting with `==` (such as this one) in this file are treated 
== as "comments" here, as well as in some file-parse algorithms we have 
== elsewhere, even though there is no such thing as a comment in text files. 
== by "comment" we mean that these lines are helpful headers or remarks 
== but not part of the OPTIONS_GHC flags data.

== ALSO, PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE IN ANYWAY, INCLUDING ADDING OR DELETING 
== SPACES OR LINES, BECAUSE ANY CHANGE COULD RESULT IN FAILURE DURING FILE PARSE.

== Prem created this file in the following way:
==  1. created this file, as a copy of vim/haskell/data/OPTIONS-GHC-FLAGS-ORIGINAL.txt
==  2. removed non-applicable comments
==  3. opened this file in vim
==  4. ran `FormatOptionsGhcFlagsFile()` from vim commandline to format contents
==  5. checked data accuracy by comparing contents with haskell.org link above.
==  6. added headers, comments, etc for easy read

== NOTE: for changes to flags since GHC 8.0, see
== https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/using-warnings.html
